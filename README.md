**Financial Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard Using SQL and PowerBI** 

This project includes a comprehensive Details Dashboard that offers a user-friendly interface for accessing essential loan data. It provides detailed insights into the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance, streamlining the analysis and management of lending activities.

Bank loans are essential financial tools that support individuals and businesses in achieving their goals and managing financial needs. Borrowers should carefully understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities to make informed decisions.

## Terminologies For The Bank Loan Data

**1. Loan Application -** Banks gather loan data primarily through loan applications, where individuals or businesses provide detailed personal and financial information. This data is collected electronically or in paper form during the application process.

**2. Credit Reports -** Banks also access credit reports from credit bureaus to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness. These reports detail credit history, existing loans, and payment behavior.

**3. Internal Records -** Banks maintain internal records of loan transactions, such as disbursements, repayments, and status updates, which are stored in their databases for tracking and management.

**4. Online Portals -** Banks use online platforms where borrowers can apply for loans, make payments, and access account details. Data from these portals is collected and stored for analysis and management.

**5. Third-Party Data Sources -** Banks may also utilize third-party data sources, like income verification services, to gather additional information about borrowers for a comprehensive assessment.
